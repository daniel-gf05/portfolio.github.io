    <Biography title="About me" img="retratog.png">
        Since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by computers and the logic
        behind programming, always driven by a desire to build meaningful
        solutions. I wrote my first lines of Python at age 12, and since then,
        my relationship with technology has only deepened. I am a lifelong
        learner, dedicated to exploring new technologies every day and turning
        that curiosity into impactful software.
